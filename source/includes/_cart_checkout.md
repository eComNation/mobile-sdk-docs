All the above calls, except get cart, can have an additional parameter in access_token if the customer is logged in.

The checkout is implemented in a webview using the checkout process of the web store.
When the customer proceeds to checkout, if not logged in, he/she is asked to log in with an option to checkout as guest.

To start checkout, following **CHECKOUT URL** is opened in the webview.

>CHECKOUT URL:

```API
https://abcd.my39shop.com/checkouts/init?cart_id={cart_token_value}&is_mobile={true}
```

If the customer is logged in, append access_token parameter to the above URL. 

The customer then follows the checkout steps as the app takes him/her forward through the webview. We listen to the reload event of the web view and depending on the content of the URL that is loaded the app takes certain actions. If the URL contains the word “confirm” it means that customer has successfully placed the order so we clear the cart and on the next reload take the customer to the home screen.
